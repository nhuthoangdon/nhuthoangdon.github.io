      <h2>Bardot</h2>
      <p>
        Being one of the most iconic Australia's high fashion brands, Bardot's website had a lot to take into consideration.
        The old website was outdated with clunky header and ineffectively organised contents.
        Our job was to optimise and deliver a refreshed eCommerce website as part of their re-platform process.

  <h3>THE CHALLENGE</h3>
  <div class="wrapper">
    <div class="block">
      <p>
        As a dedicated eCommerce website,
        the project required many micro interactions, functionalities and heavy mobile optimisation.
        We had to keep in mind all aspects during the design process, from design principles to user testings, to meeting project
        timeframe and budget, so on and so forth.

      <h4>SEARCH</h4>
      <p>
        'Search' function is one important part of an eCommerce website.
        The old search bar was visually unappealing and hard to find.
        We re-designed it with trending items as a pre-suggestion because
        psychologically speaking, we thought they would serve as 'hints'
        to draw user's attention and would probably alter what they want to search for.
      </p>

      <h4>SEARCH SUGGESTIONS</h4>
      <p>
        Taking into account the scenarios and keywords customers likely to search for in an eCommerce fashion website,
        we decided to display the suggestions not only base on the keywords but were also subject to popularity/availability.
        Product tiles/images were also placed intentionally as suggestions, because after all, images speak better than words (
        particularly true in the fashion world).

    <h4 class="block-in">MINI LOGIN - CART - WISHLIST</h4>
    <div class="block no-margin-top block-in">
      <p>
        Base on results and heatmaps from user research, the majority of user interactions were within the top.
        Login, Wishlish and Bag were the most clicked.
        We decluttered the old header by removing unnecessary items, separating those links from the main category menu
        and designed a new streamlined navigation with mandatory items easily accessible.

      <p>
        We blew a new wind into the dropdown menu by integrating CTA banners (of trending items, promotions,
        collections, etc.) that were relevant to each category. We made use of the header's real estate as much as possible for
        highlight contents.

      <p>
        The project involved many stakeholders. There were quite an amount of change requests and out-of-scope features.
        Therefore, the communication had to be smooth, otherwise, the outcomes could be disastrous.
        Having been through similar projects facing the same problems, we had created a uniform communication process
        in which we made sure everyone was on track of even a slight change. Lots of compromise was also made between different
        teams and stakeholders.
